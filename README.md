Typical process includes:
1. fork project
2. `git pull` or `git clone` from github
3. pip3 installs from requirements.txt
4. create new local branch for changes `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`
5. do updates, edits, and code, test `flask run`
6. switch back to master and merge new branch into master `git checkout master; git merge <new-branch-name>`
7. `git commit -a -m 'message'`
8. `git push origin master`
9. set up pull request, or however it's done to my main repo.
